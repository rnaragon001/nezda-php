Welcome to Nezda-php!

This is the back-end for the nezda project. The front-end can be found at the nezda-js repository. Kindly run 'php -S localhost:8000' to run the server on port 8000. Port 8000 can be modified but the front end module should be updated accordingly as it is set to listen at port 8000.
